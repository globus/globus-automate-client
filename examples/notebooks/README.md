# Running the example Notebook

To run this example Jupyter notebook, make sure that you are running in an environment with both the `jupyter` and the `globus-automate-client` packages installed. For example,

```
python3 -m pip install jupyter globus-automate-client
```

To run the above using a Python virtual environment, first run:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, run `jupyter-notebook flow-deploy-and-monitor.ipynb`. 

Follow the instructions in the notebook carefully, particularly when configuring your data environment for the example execution of the Flow defined and executed within this notebook.
