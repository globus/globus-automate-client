        Classmethod to simplify creating an FlowsClient. Use this method when

        interacting with a Flow without wanting to launch an interactive login

            keyword-args: flow_url, flow_scope, client_id. Using some, all, or
            none of these args, the callback should return a GlobusAuthorizer
            which provides access to the targetted Flow.

        :param authorizer: The authorizer to use for validating requests to the
            Flows service. This authorizer is used when interacting with the
            Flow's service, it is not used for interactive with a particular
            flow. Therefore, this authorizer should grant consent to the
            MANAGE_FLOWS_SCOPE. For interacting with a particular flow, set the
            authorizer_callback parameter.
