    A helper function to handle creating a properly authenticated ``ActionClient``
    which can operate against *Globus Action Provider Interface* compliant Action
    Providers. This helper will create an ``ActionClient`` by searching for and
    storing tokens on the local filesystem, potentially triggering a log-in flow
    if the requested tokens are not found locally.

    Given the ``action_url`` for a specific ActionProvider, this function will
    attempt to create a valid ``ActionClient`` for interacting with that
    ActionProvider. If the ``action_scope`` is not provided, this function will
    attempt to discover the ``action_scope`` by querying the target Action
    Provider's introspection endpoint. If the Action Provider is not configured
    to allow public, unauthenticated access to its introspection endpoint, the
    ``action_scope`` will be non-discoverable and authentication will fail.

    With the ``action_scope`` available, the function will search for a valid
    token in the local filesystem cache. In the event that tokens for the scope
    cannot be loaded, an interactive login will be triggered. Once
    tokens have been loaded, an Authorizer is created and used to instantiate
    the ``ActionClient`` which can be used for operations against that Action
    Provider.

        exists

        for authenticating access to it
    :param client_id: The ID for the Native App Auth Client which will be
        triggering the login flow for this ActionClient
