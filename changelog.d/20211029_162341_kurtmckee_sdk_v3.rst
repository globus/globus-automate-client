Features
--------

-   Upgrade to Globus SDK v3.

Bugfixes
--------

-   Fix a bug that prevented the Flows client from properly validating flow definition states in lists.
-   Fix a bug that could allow the Flows authorizer to be lost if an exception was raised.
    (Authorizer swaps are now handled using a context manager.)
-   Prevent empty values from appearing in query parameters or JSON submissions.
-   Fix a bug that prevented the input schema of an existing Flow from being set to an all-permissive JSON schema.

Other
-----

-   Add code linting, documentation build testing, and a bunch of unit tests.
    (Code coverage of modules currently imported during testing is 73%.)
