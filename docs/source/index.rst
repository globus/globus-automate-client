.. warning::

    The Globus Automate Client is deprecated in favor of the
    `Globus CLI <https://docs.globus.org/cli/>`_ and the
    `Globus Python SDK <https://globus-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

This is the command line interface and Python package for working with the Globus
Flows service and services that implement the Globus Action Provider interface.
